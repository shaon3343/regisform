List.render at Application Controller , It should be included in view as list.scala.html to design the view of 
all the listing . 

now people Profile  listings should be displayed in a list page .

Found the solution: return ok(new FileInputStream("pdfs/doc.pdf")).as("application/pdf");

Next to do is Routing . Have to call that method in controller CreatePDF  from within view  Userprofile.scala.html 
Passing values from that view and then it will be downloaded as pDF
